This project is a GeoGuessr clone for students, using Mapillary embeds, Japanese language UI, three difficulty buttons (Easy, Medium, Hard), a help menu, and localStorage for score. Only Easy mode is functional for now with 5 preset locations. Prepare for static hosting on GitHub Pages. Do not include comments in your code.
